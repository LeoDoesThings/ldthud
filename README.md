## To Download

Click [this link](https://github.com/LeoDoesThings/ldthud/archive/master.zip) or the green `Clone or Download` button at the top of the page and then `Download ZIP` in order to download the most recent version of my hud! It should be at the top of the page. 

## To Install

Be sure to back up your old hud folder first! Never know when something might break, and it's always best to be prepared.

1. Press `Download ZIP` on Github. This will download `ldthud-master.zip`
2. Navigate to:
* Windows: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\cfg`
* MacOSX:  `~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf/cfg`
* Linux:   `~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf/cfg`
3. Extract .zip file contents into the `custom` folder.
4. Ensure that the final file structure should resembles the following:
```
tf
└── custom
    └── ldthud
        ├── cfg
        ├── materials
        ├── resource
        ├── scripts
        ├── sound
        ├── README.md
        └── info.vdf
```

### Customisation
--------

I can't help you out here, but you could do it yourself after watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JkF5lPvXk0&list=PL5eNrB8RrXXuV3P1nv6NnwF-tCL_KnJIs">raysfire's tutorial on HUD editing</a>

However this HUD works great with my configs which can be <a href="https://github.com/LeoDoesThings/cfg">found here</a>
