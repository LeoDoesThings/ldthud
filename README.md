--------

Click [this link](https://github.com/LeoDoesThings/ldthud/archive/master.zip) or the green `Clone or Download` button at the top of the page and then `Download ZIP` in order to download the most recent version of my hud! It should be at the top of the page. 

To Install
--------

Be sure to back up your old hud folder first! Never know when something might break, and it's always best to be prepared.

1. Press `Download ZIP` on Github. This will download `ldthud-master.zip`
2. Navigate to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom`
3. Extract .zip file contents into the `custom` folder.
4. Ensure that the final file structure should resembles the following:
```
tf
└── custom
    └── rayshud
        ├── customizations
        ├── materials
        ├── resource
        ├── scripts
        ├── sound
        ├── README.md
        └── info.vdf
```
